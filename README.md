#Fly Solo

Is a playground for Lara learning JavaScript and other stuff. Under the pretense of being an app to track bars that are good to go to alone.

It has a really cute URL:

flysolo.in/nyc
flysolo.in/bos
flysolo.in/pgh
flysolo.in/sf
flysolo.in/dc

And more cities. Bare in mind none of that exists yet.

Things I am learning with this project:
* libsass
* Foursquare API
* Bourbon/Neat (which are older versions because of libsass)
* Forms and JSON and stuff
