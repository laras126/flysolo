#Welcome to Fly Solo

A playground for Lara to learn more JavaScript and other stuff under the pretense of being a mobile web app to track cocktail bars that are good to go to alone.

It would have really cute URLs:

* flysolo.in/nyc
* flysolo.in/bos
* flysolo.in/pgh
* flysolo.in/sf
* flysolo.in/dc
* etc, etc.

Bare in mind none of that exists yet (other than a purchased domain), and probably won't for a while.

#### Things I am learning with this project:

* Angular (despite the progressive enhancement buzz, I still want to learn it)
* Foursquare API (big time thanks to [Carl Colombo's  angular-foursquare repo](https://github.com/carlo-colombo/angular-foursquare))
* Forms and stuff
* Geolocation
* Yoeman and Bower and Grunt and complicated build stuff

#### To-do

Ultimately (or at least what I'm thinking at the moment), this will allow a user to:

1. Authenticate with Foursquare
2. Find a bar by typing in it's name
3. See details about the bar
4. Save the bar to a public Foursquare list
5. View the list

There's also a file called stories.txt that has some more info, mainly "nice to haves". This list is much more feasible.

It'd be cool to not depend on Foursquare lists, and use MongoDB instead - that will be phase 2.

#### Cool!
